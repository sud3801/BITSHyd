# Polynomial Multiplication

Polynomial multiplication using linked lists is an efficient way to handle algebraic operations on polynomials of any degree.

## Implementation

Here's how polynomials are represented and multiplied using linked lists:

```c
typedef struct Term {
    int coefficient;
    int exponent;
    struct Term* next;
} Term;

typedef struct {
    Term* head;
} Polynomial;

// Create new term
Term* createTerm(int coeff, int exp) {
    Term* term = (Term*)malloc(sizeof(Term));
    term->coefficient = coeff;
    term->exponent = exp;
    term->next = NULL;
    return term;
}

// Insert term into polynomial
void insertTerm(Polynomial* poly, int coeff, int exp) {
    Term* newTerm = createTerm(coeff, exp);
    
    if (!poly->head || exp > poly->head->exponent) {
        newTerm->next = poly->head;
        poly->head = newTerm;
        return;
    }
    
    Term* current = poly->head;
    while (current->next && current->next->exponent > exp) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    newTerm->next = current->next;
    current->next = newTerm;
}

// Multiply two polynomials
Polynomial* multiply(Polynomial* p1, Polynomial* p2) {
    Polynomial* result = (Polynomial*)malloc(sizeof(Polynomial));
    result->head = NULL;
    
    Term* term1 = p1->head;
    while (term1) {
        Term* term2 = p2->head;
        while (term2) {
            int coeff = term1->coefficient * term2->coefficient;
            int exp = term1->exponent + term2->exponent;
            insertTerm(result, coeff, exp);
            term2 = term2->next;
        }
        term1 = term1->next;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Representation**
   - Each term has coefficient, exponent, and next pointer
   - Terms are stored in descending order of exponents
   - Zero coefficients are typically omitted

2. **Multiplication Process**
   - Multiply each term of first polynomial with each term of second
   - Add exponents and multiply coefficients
   - Combine like terms (same exponents)
   - Maintain descending order of exponents

3. **Time Complexity**
   - For polynomials of length m and n: O(m*n)
   - Additional space complexity: O(m*n)

## Example

For polynomials:
- P1(x) = 3x² + 2x + 1
- P2(x) = 2x + 1

The multiplication P1(x) * P2(x) results in:
- (3x²)(2x) = 6x³
- (3x²)(1) = 3x²
- (2x)(2x) = 4x²
- (2x)(1) = 2x
- (1)(2x) = 2x
- (1)(1) = 1

Combining like terms:
- Result = 6x³ + 7x² + 4x + 1

## Applications

1. **Algebraic Computations**
   - Symbolic mathematics
   - Computer algebra systems
   - Mathematical modeling

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Convolution operations
   - Digital filters
   - Frequency analysis

3. **Numerical Methods**
   - Interpolation
   - Curve fitting
   - Approximation algorithms

## Advantages of Linked List Implementation

1. **Dynamic Size**
   - No fixed size limitation
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Easy to add/remove terms

2. **Ordered Storage**
   - Terms maintained in descending order
   - Efficient combination of like terms
   - Easy to print in standard form

3. **Sparse Polynomial Handling**
   - Only non-zero terms stored
   - Efficient for sparse polynomials
   - Reduced memory usage
